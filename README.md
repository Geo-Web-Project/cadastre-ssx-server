## Local Development

### Setup w3up client

You will need a local configuration for w3up client. Please see [w3cli](https://github.com/web3-storage/w3cli) to register and create a space.

Once that is complete, point the ssx-server to the configuration by setting the env variable:

```
export W3_STORE_NAME=w3cli
```
